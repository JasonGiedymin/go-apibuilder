# Api-Builder

While building a docker client, I wanted an easier and more controlled means
of creating client APIs while not sacrificing control of handling the response.
Yet I also wanted a means of knowing when (retrospectively) an Api was not in
sync (albeit) within that usage scope.

Note: This repo is in heavy construction

There exists a todo `todo.md` in source.
